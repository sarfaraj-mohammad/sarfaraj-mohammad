# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”­ About me

ðŸŒ± I'm Sarfaraj, a seasoned data scientist and engineer dedicated to harnessing the power of data to unlock insights and create impact. With a Master's degree in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington and extensive experience as a Senior Data Engineer at LTIMindtree, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table.

âœ¨ My skill set spans a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and cloud platforms, including Python, SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Microsoft Azure, Snowflake, Power BI and more. I specialize in designing and implementing robust big data infrastructure, developing advanced machine learning models, and optimizing data pipelines for efficiency and scalability. In my previous role of Senior Data Engineer, I led initiatives to implement data infrastructure and ETL pipelines using Microsoft Azure, developed real-time streaming data pipelines with Azure Event Hub and Kafka, set up Snowflake Data Warehouse for hosting petabytes of historical data and leveraged Power BI for analytics and data-driven decision making.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science / Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Data Analysis projects.

ðŸ’¬ My goal is simple: to help organizations harness the full potential of their data to make informed decisions and drive business growth. Let's connect and explore how we can turn your data into a strategic asset!
